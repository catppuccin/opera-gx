Hey there, welcome to the mod creation template based on the Purple Haze theme
from  Opera GX. This  template  includes the original keyboard sounds, browser
sounds, and music from Opera GX, as well as light and dark wallpapers that are
based on the original Purple Haze wallpapers but have added information at the
bottom to set them apart. There is also an example of animated wallpaper.

We've also included a simple web  modding  CSS that changes the text color and
background  color on web pages in the opera.com domain. This will show you how
to read colors from the browser and apply them to web pages. And lastly, we've
included  basic shaders  that  demonstrate  how  to  use  animated and  static
versions. Have fun creating your mods!
